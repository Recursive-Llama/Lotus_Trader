# Alpha Data Detector - Documentation Index

*Source: [alpha_detector_build_convo.md](../alpha_detector_build_convo.md)*

## 🌱 Evolutionary Thesis

**We don't "build the best detector." We breed many small detectors, measure them under the same discipline, and let the survivors advance.**

This repo is a lab, not a factory:
- **Parallel variation**: many simple models > one grand model
- **Natural selection**: promotion/retirement by metrics, not narrative  
- **Governed change**: contracts, configs, and operator rituals keep evolution safe

**Mantra**: Trust the ensemble and the numbers. Prune with zero regret.

## 🧠 The Deeper Message

**Evolution is not just a technical approach - it's a complete cultural transformation:**

- **Eliminate human bias** through systematic constraints
- **Build institutional memory** through failure logging  
- **Force difficult choices** through artificial scarcity
- **Prevent narrative thinking** through language discipline
- **Maintain diversity** through active monitoring
- **Execute ruthlessly** through zero-regret pruning

**Stories must be quantified and testable. If you can't measure it, it's narrative bias.**

2. **Kalman** - State-space models with trend/volatility regimes
3. **Order Flow** - Queue imbalance, depth slope, MO intensity models
4. **Basis/Carry** - Funding/OI/volatility models for perp-spot basis
5. **Lead-Lag Network** - Cointegration and correlation models across assets
6. **Breadth/Market Mode** - Market-wide regime classification models
