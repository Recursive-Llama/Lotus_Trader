# Raw Data Intelligence CIL Integration Plan

## 🎯 **Purpose & Scope**

This document outlines how to evolve the existing `raw_data_intelligence/` agents to work seamlessly with the Central Intelligence Layer (CIL), transforming them from independent detectors into strategic team members that participate in organic intelligence coordination.

**Key Insight**: CIL is architecturally "just another team" but functionally the manager of the system. Management happens through **organic influence** - superior insights, resonance patterns, and strategic guidance that teams naturally want to follow - not through hierarchical control.

## 💓 **Data-Driven Heartbeat: The Foundation of Organic Intelligence**

### **🎯 Critical Insight: Market Data as System Heartbeat**

The entire organic intelligence system is powered by a **data-driven heartbeat** that eliminates the need for manual triggering, cron jobs, or scheduled tasks. **Market data arrival is the natural pulse** that drives all system activity.

#### **The 1-Minute Heartbeat Cycle**:
```
Every Minute: New Market Data Arrives
    ↓
Triggers Variable Response Frequencies:
    • Raw Data Agents: 1-minute analysis (immediate response)
    • Pattern Agents: 5-minute analysis (accumulated data)
    • CIL Synthesis: 15-minute analysis (cross-team patterns)
    • Strategic Planning: 30-minute analysis (longer-term trends)
    • Doctrine Updates: 60-minute analysis (learning consolidation)
    ↓
Cascading Organic Effects:
    • Data → Analysis → Strands → CIL → Meta-signals → More Analysis
    • Uncertainty Detection → Exploration Triggers → Discovery
    • Pattern Clustering → Resonance Calculation → Strategic Insights
    • Cross-team Confluence → Experiment Design → Learning
```

#### **Why This Matters**:
- **No Manual Intervention**: System self-activates based on data flow
- **Organic Growth**: More data = more analysis = more intelligence
- **Natural Rhythm**: System follows market rhythm, not artificial schedules
- **Scalable Activation**: Different agents respond at optimal frequencies
- **Uncertainty-Driven**: Data gaps and low confidence become exploration triggers

#### **Integration with Raw Data Intelligence**:
The `alpha_market_data_1m` table becomes the **system heartbeat** that:
- **Triggers immediate analysis** by raw data intelligence agents
- **Accumulates for pattern detection** by higher-level agents
- **Feeds uncertainty detection** when data quality is low or patterns are unclear
- **Drives CIL synthesis** when cross-team patterns emerge
- **Powers resonance calculations** through continuous data flow

#### **Variable Response Architecture**:
```python
# Different agents respond at different frequencies to the same heartbeat
class DataDrivenHeartbeat:
    """Market data as system heartbeat with variable response frequencies"""
    
    async def on_market_data_arrival(self, market_data: Dict[str, Any]):
        """Every minute: new market data triggers variable responses"""
        
        # Immediate response (1-minute agents)
        await self.trigger_raw_data_analysis(market_data)
        
        # Accumulated response (5-minute agents)
        await self.accumulate_for_pattern_analysis(market_data)
        
        # Strategic response (15-minute agents)
        await self.accumulate_for_cil_synthesis(market_data)
        
        # Learning response (60-minute agents)
        await self.accumulate_for_doctrine_updates(market_data)
    
    async def trigger_uncertainty_exploration(self, data_quality: float):
        """Low data quality or unclear patterns trigger exploration"""
        if data_quality < 0.7:
            await self.publish_uncertainty_strand({
                'uncertainty_type': 'data_quality',
                'exploration_priority': 'high',
                'resolution_suggestions': ['data_validation', 'pattern_clarity_check']
            })
```

## 📊 **Current State Analysis**

### ✅ **What's Already Built (Raw Data Intelligence)**
- **6 Specialized Agents**: volume_analyzer, divergence_detector, time_based_patterns, market_microstructure, cross_asset_analyzer, raw_data_intelligence_agent
- **Database-Centric Communication**: All agents publish to AD_strands table
- **Tagging System**: Uses existing agent communication protocol
- **Vector Search Integration**: Agents participate in clustering and learning
- **LLM Integration**: Agents use LLM for analysis and pattern detection

### ❌ **What's Missing for Organic CIL Integration**
- **Data-Driven Heartbeat Integration**: Agents don't respond to market data arrival as the natural system heartbeat with variable response frequencies
- **Organic Trigger Architecture**: Agents use fixed intervals instead of data-driven activation with cascading effects
- **Uncertainty-Driven Exploration**: Agents don't treat data gaps and low confidence as exploration opportunities that drive system activity
- **Resonance Participation**: Agents don't contribute to φ, ρ, θ calculations that drive organic evolution
- **Strategic Insight Consumption**: Agents don't naturally benefit from CIL's panoramic view
- **Motif Card Integration**: Agents don't work with or create motif strands that enable pattern evolution
- **Uncertainty-Driven Curiosity**: Agents don't publish uncertainty strands that drive exploration (they calculate low confidence but treat it as failure rather than opportunity)
- **Organic Influence Reception**: Agents don't naturally follow valuable CIL insights through resonance
- **Cross-Team Pattern Awareness**: Agents don't benefit from CIL's cross-team pattern detection
- **Strategic Meta-Signal Consumption**: Agents don't naturally subscribe to valuable CIL meta-signals
- **Doctrine Integration**: Agents don't learn from or contribute to strategic doctrine organically
- **Uncertainty as Default**: Agents don't embrace uncertainty as the default state and valuable exploration driver

## 🚀 **Organic Integration Strategy**

### **Phase 1: Resonance-Driven Agent Evolution (Days 1-3)**

#### **Step 1.1: Add Resonance Integration**
**File**: `src/intelligence/raw_data_intelligence/resonance_integration.py`

    async def calculate_strand_resonance(self, strand_data: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, float]:
        """Calculate φ, ρ values that drive organic evolution"""
        # Calculate φ (fractal self-similarity)
        # Calculate ρ (recursive feedback)
        # Update telemetry (sr, cr, xr, surprise)
        # Contribute to global θ field
        
    async def find_resonance_clusters(self, pattern_type: str) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
        """Find resonance clusters that indicate valuable patterns"""

        # Evaluate data sufficiency (insufficient data = exploration opportunity)
        # Calculate confidence levels (low confidence = curiosity driver)
        # Identify uncertainty types that drive exploration

        # Extract pattern invariants
        # Identify failure conditions
        # Provide mechanism hypotheses
        # Create motif strand with resonance values
        
    async def calculate_resonance_contribution(self, strand_data: Dict[str, Any]):
        """Calculate resonance contribution for organic evolution"""
