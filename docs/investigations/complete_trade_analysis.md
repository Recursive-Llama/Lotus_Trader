## Recommendations

1. **Remove 1m timeframe** - Underperforming (-6.6% avg ROI, 33.3% win rate), both S1 and S2 are negative
2. **Focus on 15m S1 entries** - They're performing well when held (9.0% avg ROI, 100% win rate)
3. **Focus on 1h S2 entries** - Excellent performance (21.9% avg ROI, 100% win rate)
4. **Avoid 15m S2 entries** - Underperforming in closed trades (-4.9% avg ROI)
5. **The system is working** - Open positions significantly outperform closed trades, suggesting good risk management

## Next Steps

1. **Switch learning system to ROI-based** instead of RR-based
2. **Focus analysis on 15m trades** (removing 1m)
3. **Deep dive into learning system** - How can we learn from these patterns?
4. **Investigate why 1h S2 entries are so successful** - Can we replicate this?
