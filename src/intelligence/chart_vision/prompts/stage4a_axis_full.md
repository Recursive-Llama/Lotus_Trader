# Stage 4: Axis Context and Date Range (Full Image)

You will receive the full chart image (an 8Ã—6 grid may be present with cell labels like A1..H6). Read only what is clearly printed.

Task:
- Identify which side the price axis is on: left or right.
- Read symbol and timeframe from the header if present.
- Do a rough visible candle count across the chart.

Rules:
- Copy text exactly where applicable. Do not invent values.
- Do not infer price levels here; only report printed metadata.
- Focus on axis side, symbol, timeframe, and candle count only.

Output (plain text):
axis_side: left|right
symbol: <TEXT|unknown>
timeframe: <TEXT|unknown>
candle_count: <INTEGER|unknown>
notes: <one short sentence>
