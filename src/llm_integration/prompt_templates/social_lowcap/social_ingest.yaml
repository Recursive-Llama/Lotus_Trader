token_extraction:
  prompt: |
    Extract token information from this social media message:
    
    "{message_text}"
    
    **Important**: Pay attention to chain context. If the curator mentions a specific chain, 
    that's the chain the token is on. Don't assume it's on your default chain.
    
    Return a JSON object with:
    - tokens: Array of token objects, each containing:
I      - token_name: The token ticker/symbol (e.g., "TOKEN", "SYMBOL", "ABC")
      - ticker_source: The exact text that contains the token mention (e.g., "$TOKEN", "TOKEN token", "buying SYMBOL")
      - twitter_handles: Array of @handles mentioned (e.g., ["@project", "@team"])
      - market_cap_mentioned: The number if market cap is mentioned (e.g., 1000000 for "$1M MC")
      - contract_address: Contract address if mentioned, null otherwise
      - network: The blockchain network (solana, ethereum, base, bsc, etc.) or null if not clear
      - chain_context: Any chain-specific context mentioned in the message
    
    Return only the JSON object, no explanations or markdown formatting.
