token_extraction:
  prompt: |
    Extract token information from this social media message:
    
    "{message_text}"
    
    **Important**: Pay attention to chain context. If the curator mentions a specific chain, 
    that's the chain the token is on. Don't assume it's on your default chain.

    - tokens: Array of token objects, each containing:
      - token_name: The token ticker/symbol

      - contract_address: Contract address if mentioned, null otherwise
      - chain_context: Any chain-specific context mentioned in the message
      - sentiment: positive, negative, or neutral
      - confidence: 0.0 to 1.0
      - has_chart: true if post contains chart/image, false otherwise
      - chart_type: type of chart if present (price, volume, technical, etc.) or null
      - market_context: Object with price_mention, market_cap, risk_assessment, competitors, platform
      - trading_signals: Object with action (set to "buy" if the token is discussed positively/favorably, null otherwise), timing, confidence
