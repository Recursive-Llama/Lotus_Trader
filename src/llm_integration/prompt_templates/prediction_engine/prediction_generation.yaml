        FOCUS AREAS:
        - Pattern recognition and analysis
        - Market context integration
        - Prediction confidence assessment
        - Risk factor identification
        - Actionable insights extraction
      prompt: |
        Analyze the following pattern group and generate a comprehensive prediction review.
        
        PATTERN GROUP:
        - Asset: {asset}
        - Timeframe: {timeframe}
        - Group Type: {group_type}
        - Patterns: {patterns}
        - Market Context: {market_context}
        - Historical Performance: {historical_performance}
        
        ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:
        1. Pattern Analysis
           - Identify the key pattern characteristics
           - Assess pattern strength and reliability
           - Evaluate pattern consistency across timeframes
        
        2. Market Context Integration
           - How does current market context affect the pattern?
           - What market conditions favor this pattern?
           - What external factors could impact the pattern?
        
        3. Prediction Generation
           - What is the most likely outcome?
           - What are the alternative scenarios?
           - What is the confidence level for each prediction?
        
        4. Risk Assessment
           - What are the key risk factors?
           - What could cause the prediction to fail?
           - How should risk be managed?
        
        5. Actionable Insights
           - What specific actions should be taken?
           - What conditions should be monitored?
           - What are the key success factors?
