CIL Prediction and Conditional Trading Plan Flow Test

This script demonstrates the complete CIL flow for:
1. Creating prediction plans from raw data intelligence
2. Testing predictions against market outcomes
3. Creating conditional trading plans based on successful predictions
4. Learning and improving from outcomes

This is the missing piece - CIL as a prediction and trading plan system!
